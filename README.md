## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Balatro Multiplayer Mod! Here's how you can help:

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Clearly explain the feature you have implemented in the pull request
- Ensure to properly test the feature and provide example seeds where the feature can clearly be seen working (if relevant)

Contributions that make content changes like modifying how the base game works, adding cards or blinds, or adding gamemodes will likely not be accepted. We are currently trying to maintain the competitive integrity of the mod and these types of changes need to be decided on by our team before being added.

### Looking to contribute but don't have a feature in mind?

Check the [issues](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer/issues), there are usually issues with the "Help Wanted" tag that are just looking for someone to work on them! I (Virtualized) try and be very clear about what the problem is and what the expected solution is in these issues so hopefully there is little confusion, but feel free to DM or ping `virtualized` on discord for clarification.

## ‚úÖ Testing

Unit tests live in the `spec/` directory and can be executed locally with [Busted](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/):

```bash
luarocks install busted
luarocks install luassert
busted spec
```

All pushes and pull requests automatically run these checks via the **Lua Tests** workflow in GitHub Actions.
